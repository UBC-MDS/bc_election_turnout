# BC Election Turnout project

In this data analysis project, we work on a publicly available data sets to answer the following inferential question: 

> Is a closer election correlated with the higher turnout?. In other word, do we have a higher turnout in a tight elections?

To answer this question, We have used two publicaly available data set from BC government [provincial voter participation](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/6d9db663-8c30-43ec-922b-d541d22e634f/resource/646530d4-078c-4815-8452-c75639962bb4/download/provincial_voter_participation_by_age_group.csv) and [provincial voting results](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/44914a35-de9a-4830-ac48-870001ef8935/resource/fb40239e-b718-4a79-b18f-7a62139d9792/download/provincial_voting_results.csv).

The data provides us voting results from 2005 - 2017 for different Electoral District (ED). This data set give us the opportunity to investigate the relation between the difference in votes between the winner and the runner up and the turn out at different Electoral District for several years.
