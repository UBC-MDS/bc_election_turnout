## Contributing to bc_elections_turnout

This analysis repo is an academic project organized under the umbrella of the [UBC's Master of Data Science program](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/).

### Our Development Philosophy

- We use a fork + pull-request (PR) approach to development. 
The `main` branch is protected and we require at least one reviewer per PR.

- We search Github issues before contributing a PR to ensure a similar query has not yet been posed or closed.

- We aim to create [minimal reproducible examples](https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/help-me-help-you-creating-reproducible-examples/) whenever discussing bugs or problems.
We attempt to do this on Docker before reporting an issue, when possible.

- We document everything with `roxygen2`, `docopt`, or docstrings.

- We strive to write code that adheres to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). We do this for consistency and ease of collaboration, rather than for its own sake. 
When appropriate, we welcome deviations from style. 

- We test our code using `testthat` or analogous frameworks.

- We try to write code that will be reproducible across platforms and time.


For general guidance on how to contribute, please consult the [tidyverse development contributing guide](https://www.tidyverse.org/contribute/).
