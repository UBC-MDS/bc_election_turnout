Scatter plot:
The scatter plot shows the correlation between turn out rate per election district and competitiveness. Turn out rate of different election years are marked with different symbols. As we can see, a positive relationship is observed between turnout rate and competitiveness. And this relationship will be further tested in our statistical analysis below.
